All part of "How to thrive in your career" thread:

### Main thread



**How to thrive**
* How to thrive in your career Thriving = being able to work on the problems you want, with people you respect, while having wealth that makes working a choice rather than a necessity.
* Thriving = (material) freedom.
* Understand the game. Companies are designed to generate profits. A company values you proportional to your ability to positively impact its bottom line.
* There are 2 types of signals of ability to create value for a company: true, irrefutable signals & proxy signals.
* True, irrefutable signals of competence comes from tangibly creating value in a way that doesn't leave room for doubt over your abilities.
* E.g. "Created Gmail." / "Designed first set of icons, typefaces for Macintosh." / "Led enterprise cloud business to $10m annual recurring revenue (3x) over 18 months."
* Your resume becomes shorter as you develop true signals of competence. The most powerful resume is not having one: when your reputation for creating value precedes you.
* Thriving = not needing a resume.
* Proxy signals are signals gained by association with others who share your proxy signal, and also have true, irrefutable signals of competence. Working on a team / company that performed well, degrees from prestigious institutions, awards, etc. Room for doubt over your competence exists.
* Proxy signals have value because forming biases by pattern matching is ingrained into the human subconscious mind: "He's probably smart because he went to the same college as [ceo of famous tech company]".
* Most of us chase proxy signals of competence: fancy titles, subordinate headcounts, money raised, high compensation, awards, etc. because we crave high status in our packs and proxy signals are the quickest ways to quench that craving.
* But having only proxy signals => doubt still exists over your competence => many will ignore you, more work to get interviews, longer interviews, limited compensation => NOT thriving.
* Eventually the world will know whether you can create actual value or whether you're posturing.
* Creating tangible, actual value is something no one can take away from because it's a skill that is trained, not an asset that is outside of your control.
* **A mind that can create value in this world, though it might be broke today, going through a recession, laid off, etc. - does not tremble. Its value is in the ability to create value, not in some external status symbol that is outside of its control.** (TODO: combine this and above tweet into a terse embodiment of this inspirational feeling).
* Therefore choose career paths to maximize rate at which you build true, irrefutable signals of competence.

OK, this sur i sin

**Founder mindset**
* Founder mindset enables you to create **tangible value** within an organization or on your own.
* What is Founder Mindset:
	* Obsession with creating tangible value (in a direction meaningful to you).
	* Not attached to the tools / path required to create value.
	* Extreme ownership: seek & take responsibility.
* What Founder Mindset is NOT 
	* Most folks who don't thrive simply don't care enough about doing great work at the company
	* NBA example: every top NBA player knows they can be traded next season, it's "just business". But that doesn't stop the best from giving it their all to win with their current team. The ability to create value for their team is what protects them in the long-run by increasing their demand in the world.
	* There's a growing trend of accepting being "jaded" wiht what you're working on and treating work as a transaction: exchange hours for money. This is a limiting mindset that prevents you from thriving.
		* This is such a negative impact on peoples' minds. Damn son.

**Maximize learning rate**
* Learning is measured not by time spent, but by iterations of the learning cycle.
* Learning cycle = talking to users, determining what to create, creating it, shipping it, measuring how well it does, and gaining insights re. the truth that shapes your next cycle.
* Rate of learning is incredibly important. Learning compounds exponentially. In Tech there's no upper bound to what you can create once you break out of the mediocre, grade-level system. Break through as quickly as possible.
* Measure of leadership isn't measured by how many in your team like you. It's measured by ability to sustainably deliver outcomes over a long period of time. Of course you need your team's respect, but leadership without outcomes isn't leadership, it's posturing.
* When stakes are high (i.e. the larger & more established your company is), the more you have to work to earn the right to creating value. Your opportunity to create value is proportional to your opportunity to fail. If you lead a team to create a product, but all final product decisions are determined by a larger committee, then you have no opportunity to fail (any failure is a committee failure), therefore you have no opportunity to create value. (TODO: this is a very important point - need to put this into the section that describes the company environment that enables you to create value)
* There are 2 processes to train Founder Mindset: internal and environmental.
* Internal process: the way you internalize situations, how you engage with others, basically everything that happens in your mind. Internal processing differences leads to 2 individuals with similar experiences on paper growing in very different ways.
* Environmental process: 
	* **People**. 
	* **Rate of cycles**. How quickly does the company execute? (TODO: emphasize this as: if you aren't fixated on a particular company / problem that requires longer cycles, then choose an environment esp early in career that moves fucking fast: with short cycle time. You can use this as a benchmark for every future experience in career: even those in which cycle time is slower. Once you feel speed, you will push every cycle you encounter in the future to be faster. You'll be addicted to Speed... the good kind of Speed -> ofc need to take into account things like Theranos and Zenefits lol - move fast, but don't break things depending on the domain that you're in)...

**How to evaluate opportunities**
* Maximize rate of learning of Founder Mindset - which will enable you to create irrefutable, tangible value.
* High range, high variance, no upper bounds.
* Learning compounds. Exponential learning curve.
* Threshold of "you control your destiny".
* What is learning? How to maximize learning rate?
* Learning is measured not by time spent, but by iterations of the learning cycle.
* Learning cycle = talking to users, determining what to create, creating it, shipping it, measuring how well it does, determining what the next direction is. ()
* Rate of learning of the right skills that enable you to build irrefutable signal of competence is the most important factor when evaluating a job opportunity.
* Rate of learning is incredibly important. Learning compounds exponentially. In Tech there's no upper bound to what you can create once you break out of the mediocre, grade-level system. Break through as quickly as possible.

### Subs

*(What follows isn't natural continuation).*
* What is the right job opportunity that maximizes progress towards building true, irrefutable signal of competence?
* Great team.
* Opportunity to gain greater responsibilities with good execution.
* Must have a culture that __.
* If possible, choose in-person vs. remote. People underestimate in-person learning advantages when you're surrounded by great people.
* But remotely for a high learning rate company >> in-person stagnant company.
* Pre product-market fit startups aren't worth the risk. Most will fail. You're better off just starting something yourself. But ignore this advice if you see something special at an early stage startup. Prepare for suffering :).
* Rare for large companies to afford you the opportunity to fail __ (need to word this better).
* But you can be more creative than you think. Internet has opened up a new class of interesting, potentially high learning rate jobs. E.g. hustling your way as a tech person on Mr. Beast's team. Or building an AI software stack for an upcoming rapper.
	* Might look stupid today, but 
	- These learning experiences can actually be more fruitful than joining a company.
	- You could also consider starting your own thing.

**Company compensation** (This feels like more of a side point / additional benefit rather than be a part of the core thread. At the same time, compensation is important to spell out bec. this is the primary means of evaluating opportunities for most young folks).
* Companies have 2 compensation systems: "Grade-Level" and "Pay-Whatever-Necessary".
* Grade-Level is transparent step function: Engineer/Designer/Manager 1, 2, 3, principle, staff, etc. with clearly defined compensation packages. This transparency is good for the company: reduces lobbying for raises and internal politics.
* But Grade-Level pay systems often can't attract the best talent, therefore, companies pay whatever they can for top talent.
* Competence in creative domains (like Tech) has high variance and range. The best are orders of magnitude more effective than the average.
* Grade-level system severely undercompensates the best. The only way to earn what you're worth is to break out of the Grade-Level system.
* Having true signals of competence enables you to graduate out of the grade-level system.

**Founder Mindset**
* True signals are earned by creating value. Creating value is done by making something people want, selling it to them, and capturing some of the economic value created by your product.
* Creating value is the name of the game whether within a company someone other than you founded, or your own.
* Train yourself in the Founder Mindset.
* Earn the right to create value.
* By working on problems you actually care about, with teammates you deeply respect gives you energy to create value.
* -> Identify with the founder mindset, not some particular programming language / technology, etc.

**How to learn**
* Learning is measured not by time spent, but by iterations of the learning cycle.
* Learning cycle = talking to users, determining what to create, creating it, shipping it, measuring how well it does, determining what the next direction is. ()
* Rate of learning of the right skills that enable you to build irrefutable signal of competence is the most important factor when evaluating a job opportunity.
* Rate of learning is incredibly important. Learning compounds exponentially. In Tech there's no upper bound to what you can create once you break out of the mediocre, grade-level system. Break through as quickly as possible.

**How to get interviews**
(Finish the entire first section before you get here -> ensure that the foundation is laid well before you start building on it. This section is NOT independent of the first. It's an additional layer that puts into practice the theoretical foundation of the first section. Amen.).
* 

**Right mindset**


### Notes
* Proxy signals hierarchy:
	* Competence by association, diluted by number of people that share signal: 
		* Part of a successful company during its rise.
		* Prestigious college.
	* Titles and status games (Awards, etc.).
* Thriving = escaping the grade-level system.
* Do this by doing whatever is necessary to create value. Don't be limited by your title. Creating value is often a cross-department, cross-role work. **If a company doesn't allow for this type of work, join another company.**
* Don't play status games. Do the best job you can at whatever you do to create value.
* At the end of the day, only true, irrefutable signals will enable you to thrive.
* Attitude is a super important factor in "right skills". It is a skill that must be trained. Talk about it there. Amen.
* A good heuristic: is there a way to earn the opportunity to fail? You cannot have true signals of competence if failure is not a possibility -> def need to reword this. I get the gist. But doesn't make any sense.
* Climbing grade-level system is literally a ladder / rat race. Creating value is far more freeing.
* It helps to be passionate about the problem the company is trying to solve - passion and purpose enable you to work harder.
* Work in-person if possble due to subconscious elements of learning from teammates.
* Working remotely with a better company is better than in-person with a worse one. 
	* Find an opportunity to move in-person ASAP.
* Thriving is a training of the mind, not any material outcome. Money can be taken, burnt, evaporated, burnt. Tough to steal your ability to create value... that can only be earned through the right mental training.
* Important point about finding the problem you're working on meaningful & respecting your teammates and the founders. This is a formula to bring out the best work rather than be a mercinary on compensation (bar exceptional cases in which you absolutely need immediate capital for some reason).
	* Stress this point. I don't want people to interpret this playbook as a mercenary path. Amen.
* The identity you identify with / attach yourself with is such an important piece of the puzzle. Possibly the most important piece of the puzzle.
* Dedicating yourself to creating outsized value for the company is what will protect you. The company you create value you for might not exist tomorrow, that's besides the point, but the tangible evidence of your ability to create value will not go unnoticed - and that will protect you.

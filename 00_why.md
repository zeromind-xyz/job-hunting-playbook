## Why?
(The purpose of this section is to motivate readers to see the incredible value of job hunting and to make them CRAVE getting better at this skill. Use real-world examples - including ones outside of Tech to really drive home the reasons).

Joining the right company is the highest impact action you can take to become great at your craft.

You are the average of the people you interact with. This is a fundamental human principle: we learn from those around us both consciously and subconsciously. There's a reason elite runners train together and the best engineers join a small subset of companies in the world: they want to be around those that are great so that they can learn faster and be pushed to be better.

In creative fields like Tech, the best teams are often an order of magnitude more effective than average teams. You might think that joining an average company is only, say, half as bad for you as joining a world class engineering team... sadly that's far from true. The best engineering teams are likely >> 1000x more effective than the average engineering teams.

To demonstrate: when WhatsApp was acquired by Meta, it had 50 engineers who had built the system that was serving almost a billion people on the planet. That's on average 20 million users per engineer! Compare this to, say, joining a large software consulting company with tens of thousands of engineers working on various different projects many of which never see actual user adoption.

Where do you think you'll learn more?

## What you'll learn.
Learning the skill of identifying the right companies to join and knowing how to convince them to hire you will radically improve your career outcomes - and that's what this playbook will teach you.

In addition to the theory of the framework, this playbook contains practical examples from real-world situations, Notion templates to help you organize your execution and links to other helpful resources. However, this playbook does NOT cover how to do well on your software engineering interview itself, or how to become a better software engineer. Those topics are covered well and we've referenced resources we love in /resources.

Over the past few years of helping dozens of prospective engineers land their first software engineering job, I’ve learned that most new grads barely have any clue on how to job hunt effectively. As a result their careers are limited by the opportunities presented to them at their career fairs, etc. which is such an unnecessary, artificial limitation they’ve applied on their lives. I want to help you break past that.

## The opportunity.
Software is eating the world [x]. Every industry you can imagine will be significantly driven by software in the coming decades. Every. Single. One. The demand for good software engineers far outstrips the supply today - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. 

The global pandemic has accelerated the adoption of software in most industries as we saw that automated systems are simply more resistent to global catastrophes. Along with a greater adoption of software, we've seen a huge cultural shift towards remote working: many companies today are remote-first [x], or at the least, remote-friendly. Over the course of the pandemic we've also seen the tech-legal infrastructure come in place that enables companies to easily hire talent from anywhere on the planet. 

This cultural shift is a boon for those of you that are competent but don't happen to be in a major Tech hub. As long as you have an internet connection, have the skills - this playbook will teach you how to land jobs at some of the top remote friendly companies on the planet. In today's world, as an engineer, you have no excuse: your destiny is in your hands. 

With patient, persistent work you can build a fantastic career for yourself. Let's get to it!

# 1. How companies hire
Learn about the types of Tech companies, how they hire and how to take advantage of their hiring processes to maximize your chances of getting their attention.

## What is a company?
A company is a fictional entity that behaves like a living organism. As a living being it has a strong craving to survive and grow. It does this by creating a product or service that other people or organizations are willing to pay for, and they give it to them in exchange for money.

This money a company receives for selling something is called revenue. Revenue minus the cost it takes the company to create its product / service is its profits.

Every single action that a company takes must tie back to its bottom line: to maximize long-term profits. These days I hear statements like "Argh,they care more about the bottom line than their employees" - but this is by design.

Hiring an employee is also rooted in the need to generate profits. Therefore, when you apply to a company, your job is to convince them that the value you bring to the company will result in a great net profit in the long run. If you cost $x dollars to the company, you must convince it that you'll generate >> $x in order to strongly justify hiring you.

This means that when you apply to a company, your main goal is to convince them that you can deliver value to them. 
**Job hunting is fundamentally a sales process: you are selling your services to a company in order to help that company generate greater profits.** 
The first step in any sales process is to understand your customer and their needs - which is what we'll go over in this chapter.

A common mistake I see candidates make is that they try to show their interest in a particular technology / programming language in the hopes that the company they're applying to will be impressed by their passion and will want to hire them. This is a naive approach. 

You should think of yourself as a solver of business problems for which you happen to use software to do so. This is a much more attractive proposal to a company because while they may change the programming languages / technologies they use to build software, what will remain constant are business problems. So if you know how to map a business problem to a technology solution and aren't attached to the specific technology you use to solve the problem, then you're far more valuable in the eyes of a company because... you will help it generate greater profits by solving business problems.

So far I've been talking about a company as a singular entity, almost personified into a single person, but of course there are multiple people working for a company who are all, in an ideal world, incentivized to increase the company's long-term profits.

But in reality is of course a lot messier in the ideal world. You'll find that there are often mis-aligned incentives within organizations and one pitch might not work for a person in the company, while the same pitch for another person in the company might work. And which role is responsible for hiring for a particular position might be different based on the company size, where it's located, among other factors.

Let's understand the ways in which companies hire.

## Traditional hiring setup
Hiring for a position in this type of company is a process driven by a recruiter. A recruiter is someone who is responsible for the end-to-end process of hiring a candidate. They're often responsible for:
1. gathering information from the engineering team to create a job description
2. posting that job on multiple platforms (such as LinkedIn, Hired.com, etc.)
3. engaging with promising candidates who apply.
4. Setting up the interviews between the candidate and various members of the team who will be interviewing them
5. Following up with the candidate post interview.
6. Either extending an offer to the candidate (or rejecting them),
7. Working with the candidate to get any final questions / concerns answered before getting the final acceptance signature from the candidate. 

After a company reaches a certain level of profits & maturity it makes sense for it to invest in recruiters to minimize the time spent by engineers in the company on the recruiting process. Remember, often engineers are the most expensive expense for a company: an engineer's hour costs more to the company than a recruiter's (usually by 30% or more), therefore any task in the recruiting process that can be handed off to a recruiter often will be.

Dealing with a recruiter as the first contact to a company is disadvantageous for you unless you''re really "good" on paper - and in this context good is associating with brand names. Brand names drastically reduces the risk of the hire, and hence companies will usually prioritize those with impressive credentials. But if you don't have these creds, then you have to work extra hard, but there is a way (which we'll cover later). - write this better.

## Small startup hiring approach
Smaller startups aren't big enough for the traditional setup: often the engineering manager / lead / cto themselves will drive the hiring process by reaching out to their network for leads and will engage directly with candidates who reach out.

## There are no rules / set ways.
- Companies might follow weird processes that might not fit into the above.
- A process does not mean that you can't leverage the system the way that benefits you: for example, even if a recruiter is running the process, if you don't have the right credentials to get past their screening, you should look to reach out to the hiring manager / an engineer on the team directly - since they're a lot more likely to engage with you (less communications going on for them), and far more accurately evaluate your skill since they are engineers as well.

Don't make any assumptions about a system. If there's one thing I want you to take away from this playbook it's that you should always operate with a system that enables you to find the truth about something: regardless of what that reality is. (OK, I get the gist, but this REALLY needs to be paraphrased) - basically I want you to have a system that will work no matter

## Notes
- Remember that the audience is raw they don't know terms that you take for granted: recruiter, hiring manager, etc. etc. Define everything from the ground up. Amen.

	"My experience being recruited:
	1. Embedded startup, <20 people.
	> I contacted them. They were one of the few tech firms in my hometown & used a SW stack that I loved. Old-school email exchange. No social media. I learned of their existence via a newspaper profile article.
	2. Semiconductor OEM, <150 people.
	> I posted about being laid off on LI. An ex-colleague saw the post & invited me in for first interviw.
	3. IoT startup, <20 people.
	> I replied to an Austin Startup jobs posting from the company recruiter.
	4. Software dev team, <10 people.
	> The dev leader cold-emailed me after seeing my details in an HN "who wants to be hired?" post."

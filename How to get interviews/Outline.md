*A battle-tested framework for software engineers - to radically increase the number of interviews you can earn*.

### Intro
* **Who** is this guide for: aspiring / current software engineers looking to job hunt. 
* **Why** I wrote this guide:
	* The art of getting interviews is perhaps the most important skill to build to maximize efficacy of job hunting.
	* Most people suck at job hunting: they treat it as job waiting, rather than creating opportunities.
* **Scope:** Playbook limited to getting interviews. For how to pass interviews, there are plenty of other guides out there (point to References).
* **Who am I**: self-promotion to establish some credibility.
* **Social proof** - embed a wall of testimonials right here in the intro section to give readers full confidence in the material before they jump in.
	* (Design this really well - make it look beautiful)

### How companies hire
* Company exists to create long-term value => the easier you can prove that you can create value, the easier you gain an interview there.
* What does it mean to demonstrate ability to "create value"?
* **There are no rules! Don't assume the processes at one company translate to another.**
* True vs. proxy signals of competence.
	* Yes, this does feel like a catch22, chicken & egg problem. (how to circumvent that?)
* Startups vs. Big Tech vs. Legacy (the 3 types of hiring processes that you normally find).
	* Use of recruiters vs. engineering managers / CTOs driving the process themselves.
		* (I mean, there's a broad spectrum here.)
* In-person vs. remote.

This is quite powerful if you ask me. Amen brother. 

### Job hunting funnel
1. Add company to list.
2. Get noticed by company
3. Company replies positively.
4. Phone screen
5. Take home assignment (?)
6. Technical interview ()
7. Offer

The goal is to get offers, but unfortunately many talented engineers over prep on the technical interview part and don't work on getting interviews => their limiting factor is ability to get interviews.

They end up with not many offers.

If you're converting every interview you get, you really have to focus on improving top-of-the-funnel.

How to organize this funnel (share the Notion template).

### Sourcing companies
List of variety of sources to find interesting / great companies to work at.

Prioritize efforts: focus on the companies that are good fits for you (what does it mean to be a good fit?).

### Pitching
You are the product that you're selling here. THIS IS A SALES PROCESS! Don't feel entitled to something or the other.

Don't ask the company what it can do for you, ask what you can do for the company (lol I like this).

(Perspective from an engineering manager's position - there is clear business pressure to build a product / fix bugs, etc. and they're looking for someone to be able to do that productively - that's the absolute baseline).

### Killer resume
* It all boils down to proof 

### Milk your network

### Art of the cold email

### Direct Message

### LinkedIn

### Github

### Tooling
* How to create a setup that leverages products and services that enables you to do a lot more.

### Cultural differences
Big vs. small companies.
Companies in the Bay Area / outside.
International companies

We've found that there are more rigid structures for companies outside of the Bay, and this reduces the willingness of companies to respond to "weird" approaches. Amen.

### Visiting offices, events, career fairs
* Cafes, offices, events, career fairs.
* **Dropping off your resume** in a physical envelope to a particular engineer with a tailored message and links to more info if they need it
	* This shit really fucking works.
* **Budgeting travels**: treat it as a cost to get interviews: fly out to your nearest Tech Hub and grind. Find places to stay at your friends and family -> apply the same Milk your Network strategy to go through family connections to find couches to crash on. Even cold email Tech founders in the city you're visiting to get a place to crash. You'd be surprised how willing people are to help when they see that you're earnestly working hard to get a job. People who work hard are help-able. Have no shame. You'll obv pay back in a big way down the line - don't forget those that helped you get to where you are.

### How to approach strangers in person

### Hustle hard
* Batshit crazy, yet respectable approaches that have worked in the past.
* Nothing ought to be below you, but you can't seem too desparate. Focus on showing how you can create value.
* Trial periods (minimally paid / paid contingently - based on a predefined goal)
	* Manage the manager: make the proposal yourself. Show clear ability to plan projects and estimate time it takes to build something.
	* Questions to ask to have enough information to propose this
* Most Tech products are out in the open. You can technically build a feature / proof of concept for a company without even talking to them.
	* Restrict this level of a time commitment for the companies that are hiring aggressively AND you really want to work at.
	* Minimize the scope and look to talk through the feature as much as you can. Minimize effort / progressively increase effort (i.e. perhaps start with a minimal product doc, then design a prototype, and then build a bare-boned proof of concept). Gradually increase the  quality and effort and continuously reach out to the team. Don't give up if the first outreach gets no response, and keep reaching out on a weekly basis.

## A. Choosing where to work

### How to thrive
* How to thrive in your career:
* Thriving = being able to work on the problems you want, with people you respect, while having wealth that makes working a choice rather than a necessity.
* Thriving = (material) freedom.
* Understand the game. Companies are designed to generate profits. A company values you proportional to your ability to positively impact its bottom line.
* There are 2 types of signals of competence: true, irrefutable signals & proxy signals.
* True, irrefutable signals of competence comes from tangibly creating value in a way that doesn't leave room for doubt over your abilities.
* E.g. "Created Gmail." / "Designed first set of icons, typefaces for Macintosh." / "Led enterprise cloud business to $10m annual recurring revenue (3x) over 18 months."
* Your resume becomes shorter, not longer, as you develop true signals of competence. The most powerful resume is not having one: when your reputation for creating value precedes you.
* Thriving = not needing a resume.
* Proxy signals are signals gained by association with others who share your proxy signal, and also have true, irrefutable signals of competence. Working on a team / company that did well, degrees from prestigious institutions, awards, etc. 
* Proxy signals have value because humans form subconscious biases through pattern matching: "She's probably smart because she went to the same college as [ceo of famous tech company]".
* Most of us subconsciously chase proxy signals of competence: fancy titles, subordinate headcounts, money raised, high compensation, awards, etc. because we crave status amongst our peers and proxy signals are the quickest ways to quench that craving.
* But having only proxy signals means there's still doubt over your competence => many will ignore you, more work to get interviews, longer interviews, limited compensation.
* Having only proxy signals of competence is NOT thriving.
* Eventually the world will know whether you can create actual value or whether you're posturing.
* Therefore, make career decisions to optimize for building true, irrefutable signals of competence.

### Founder Mindset
* Train the Founder Mindset to enable yourself to create value and thereby build true, irrefutable signals of competence.
* Founder Mindset:
* 1. Obsess over creating long-term value. (Determine what people want, create, sell).
* 2. Seek truth. (Perceive reality as it is, not as you want it to be - about what the world wants and about what you find meaningful).
* 3. Do whatever is needed. (Be attached to outcomes, not to roles / titles / tools required to deliver those outcomes). 
* 4. Embrace ownership and responsibility. (Take calculated risks. Take responsibility for your failures).
* 5. Be honest. (Your reputation follows you for your entire career. In long-term games).
* Focus on training this internal system. External results (creating value) will follow.

### Maximize Learning Rate
* Learning Founder Mindset is not measure by time spent, but by your ability to create actual, tangible value.
* The second best (and easier) way to measure learning is by number of iterations of the learning cycle.
* Learning cycle = determining what to create, creating, shipping to an audience, updating internal model of what to create, and how to best create it.
* Learning a creative skill requires training your subconscious intuition. While theory can help you choose which actions to take, you must actually act in order to get better.
* Which is why historically creative skills were taught through apprenticeships in which you created with mentorship.
* There are 2 ways to increase rate of learning: 1. Increase the number of learning cycles, 2. Improve the quality of how you update your internal model of what works.
* These are two wings of the same bird: you can't fly if you improve one without the other.
* By choosing to work at companies that move fast (more learning cycles), with teammates that are great at actually delivering value (measured by outcomes), you will learn exponentially faster than if you join an average company.
* In Tech, the range and variance of talent is high. The best engineer / designer / product manager will have 100x more opportunities and will be compensated 100x higher than the average.
* Fortunately, you don't have to sacrifice much baseline compensation in order to optimize for learning rate. Companies worth working at will pay you enough to live comfortably.

### How to evaluate opportunities
* How to choose opportunities to maximize learning rate:
* Join a company that is:
* 1. Growing exponentially (in revenue, not employee headcount, awards or BS). (Verify via public records if company public, else via fundraising rounds).
* 2. Has quality teammates: low ego, high productivity, who work to make the team greater than the sum of its parts.
* 3. Moves fast: ships updates on a daily / weekly basis. (Verify via changelogs, tweets from team, and talking to current employees).
* Hurried != moving fast. Only look at outcomes (rate of shipping changes) to understand a company's velocity. 
* 4. Rewards consistently delivering results with greater ownership and responsibility. 
* Learning rate is higher in path to success vs. path to failure. Try to join a winning team.

### Trade-offs
* Ignore legacy companies (whose prime years are behind them and growth has stagnated). Don't join a stagnating ship. You'll learn bad habits and will be worse off than when you started.
* Hardware vs. software:
* **(TODO: tersely explain how hardware companies are significantly greater risk).**
* If joining a hardware tech company, join one with a good oracle: someone who has a track record of shipping world class hardware products. Treat their feedback as market feedback to complete the learning cycle.
* E.g. Getting feedback from Steve Jobs on a weekly basis is closely equivalent to shipping a software iteration and observing how users used it.
* Without a strong oracle in hardware tech companies: learning rate is slow because the feedback loop with the market (key aspect of learning cycle) is missing, and failure rate is high (hardware is hard).
* In-person vs. remote:
* The best way to learn from a teammate is in person.
* If you're not in a global Tech hub & cannot immediately move to one (due to Visa / other issues), work remotely with a great team.
* Working with great company remotely > average company in-person.
* Look to move to a major Tech hub (SF, NYC, LDN, BLR, etc.). Surround yourself with people that are excited to build the future.
* Startup vs. Big Tech:
* Two major phases in startup lifecycle: pre & post product-market-fit (pmf).
* Product-market-fit = the inflection point at which a company has made something people want and the demand for its product far outstrips the supply. (read: https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5z-the-real-product-market-fit).
* Less than 1% of startups find product-market-fit. Unless you have strong reason not to (or if you're starting a company), only join startups AFTER they've found product-market-fit.
* Lastly, ignore all advice if you have a strong gut instinct to work with a group of people you respect to build something great, even if they have no existing visible signs of growth or success. Follow that instinct. Learn from its outcomes.
* All the best.

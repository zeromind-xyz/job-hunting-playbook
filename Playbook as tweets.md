All part of "How to thrive in your career" thread:

**How to thrive**
* How to thrive in your career:
* Thriving = being able to work on the problems you want, with people you respect, while having wealth that makes working a choice rather than a necessity.
* Thriving = (material) freedom.
* Understand the game. Companies are designed to generate profits. A company values you proportional to your ability to positively impact its bottom line.
* There are 2 types of signals of ability to create value for a company: true, irrefutable signals & proxy signals.
* True, irrefutable signals of competence comes from tangibly creating value in a way that doesn't leave room for doubt over your abilities.
* E.g. "Created Gmail." / "Designed first set of icons, typefaces for Macintosh." / "Led enterprise cloud business to $10m annual recurring revenue (3x) over 18 months."
* Your resume becomes shorter as you develop true signals of competence. The most powerful resume is not having one: when your reputation for creating value precedes you.
* Thriving = not needing a resume.
* Proxy signals are signals gained by association with others who share your proxy signal, and also have true, irrefutable signals of competence. Working on a team / company that performed well, degrees from prestigious institutions, awards, etc. Room for doubt over your competence exists.
* Proxy signals have value because forming biases by pattern matching is ingrained into the human subconscious mind: "He's probably smart because he went to the same college as [ceo of famous tech company]".
* Most of us chase proxy signals of competence: fancy titles, subordinate headcounts, money raised, high compensation, awards, etc. because we crave high status in our packs and proxy signals are the quickest ways to quench that craving.
* But having only proxy signals => doubt still exists over your competence => many will ignore you, more work to get interviews, longer interviews, limited compensation => NOT thriving.
* Eventually the world will know whether you can create actual value or whether you're posturing.
* Creating tangible, actual value is something no one can take away from because it's a skill that is trained, not an asset that is outside of your control.
* **A mind that can create value in this world, though it might be broke today, going through a recession, laid off, etc. - does not tremble. Its value is in the ability to create value, not in some external status symbol that is outside of its control.** (TODO: combine this and above tweet into a terse embodiment of this inspirational feeling).
* Therefore choose career paths to maximize rate at which you build true, irrefutable signals of competence.

**Founder mindset**
* Train the Founder Mindset to enable yourself to create value and thereby build true, irrefutable signals of competence.
* Founder Mindset:
* 1. Obsess over creating long-term value. (Determine what people want, create, sell).
* 2. Seek truth. (Perceive reality as it is, not as you want it to be - about what the world wants and about what you find meaningful).
* 3. Do what's necessary. (Be attached to outcomes, not to roles / titles / tools required to deliver those outcomes).
* 4. Embrace ownership and responsibility. (Take calculated risks. Take responsibility for your failures).
* 5. Be honest. (Cheating & lying are habits that will prevent you from working with the best and creating long-term value).
* Focus on this internal system. External results will follow.

**Maximize learning rate**
* It's not enough to simply learn the right skills to create value. Rate of learning is paramount.
* Learning is measured not by time spent doing something, but by your ability to create actual, tangible value.
* The second best (and more practical) way to measure learning is by number of iterations of the learning cycle.
* Learning cycle = determining what to create, creating, shipping to an audience, updating internal model of what to create.
* (TODO: where to talk about how this is a subconscious process and therefore you need to ACT, not just read theory. Actions are the only thing that touches the subconscious parts of mind - but does it? Yes, but need to elaborate and qualify).
* By choosing to work at companies that moves fast (more learning cycles), with teammates that are great at actually delivering value (measured by outcomes), you will learn exponentially faster than if you join an average company.
* In Tech, the range and variance of competence is high, without an upper bound. The best engineer / designer / product manager will have 100x more opportunities and will be compensated 100x higher than the average.
* Fortunately in Tech, you don't have to sacrifice much baseline compensation in order to optimize for learning rate. Companies worth working at will pay you enough to live comfortably.

**How to evaluate opportunities**
* Optimize for Founder Mindset learning rate.
* Cultural qualities of the ideal company to maximize learning rate:
* 1. Growing exponentially (in revenue, not employee headcount, awards or BS). (Verify via public records if company public, else via fundraising rounds).
* 2. Quality teammates: low ego, high productivity, who work to make the team greater than the sum of its parts.
* 3. Moves fast: ships updates on a daily / weekly basis. (Verify via changelogs, tweets from team, and talking to current employees).
* Hurried does not mean moving fast. Only look at outcomes (rate of shipping changes) to understand a company's velocity. 
* 4. Consistently delivering is rewarded with greater ownership and responsibility. 
* Learning rate higher in path to success vs. path to failure. Try to join a winning team.

**Trade offs**
* Ignore legacy companies (whose prime years are behind them and growth has stagnated). Don't join a stagnating ship. You'll learn bad habits and will be worse off than when you started.
* Hardware vs. software:
* Hardware = hardware + software => (hardware + software) vs. software.
* If joining a hardware tech company, join one with a good oracle: someone who has a track record of shipping world class hardware products. Treat their feedback as market feedback to iterate on skills.
* E.g. Getting feedback from Steve Jobs on a weekly basis is closely equivalent to shipping a software iteration and measuring results.
* Without a strong oracle in hardware tech companies: learning rate is slow because the feedback loop with the market (key aspect of learning cycle) is missing, and failure rate is high (hardware is hard).
* Ideally join after manufacturing risk minimized (they've shown ability to actually ship quality hardware).
* In-person vs. remote:
* The best way to learn from a teammate is in person. Energy is contagious and physical proximity helps team energy transfer.
* If you're not in a global Tech hub & cannot immediately move to one (due to Visa / other issues), work remotely with a great team.
* Working with great company remotely > average company in-person.
* Startup vs. Big Tech:
* Two major phases in startup lifecycle: pre & post product-market-fit (pmf).
* Product-market-fit = the inflection point at which a company has made something people want and the demand for its product far outstrips the supply. Exponential growth in users / revenue often begins at this point. (read: https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5z-the-real-product-market-fit).
* Less than 1% of startups find product-market-fit. Unless you have strong reason not to, only join startups AFTER they've found product-market-fit (more deets on how in playbook).
* Lastly, ignore all advice if you have a strong gut instinct to work with a group of people you respect to build something great, even if they have no existing visible signs of growth or success. Follow that instinct. Learn from its outcomes.
* All the best.

### Bob and Alice

It‚Äôs the spring of 2013.

Alice and Bob (real people, names changed and company names redacted) are job hunting for their first full-time job.

Bob spent the last 2 summers interning as a software engineer at well known companies: first at HP and then at IBM. A few months before graduation, when most of his peers (including Alice) were stressing about where to work, Bob had decided that he didn‚Äôt want to go through the stress of applying and interviewing at companies and took things easy. He knew that no matter what happened, he‚Äôd still have a return offer from IBM. After all, IBM was a company his parents and grandparents knew and he gained plenty of social clout in his family circles for even interning there. He had a cushy 6 figure salary job waiting for him and didn‚Äôt think much about exploring other options.

Eventually Bob managed to get interviews at 2 more companies, but accepted the IBM offer before even interviewing at the other companies. Bob was stressed and wanted to just accept the offer so that he can move on with his life without worrying about more interviews. He ended up throwing a huge party for his friends and family where he was congratulated for joining a prestigious company like IBM with an impressive 6 figure starting salary.

When Bob first joined, he was incredibly excited and engaged with work. After all, he was working on a new, massive code base, with new teammates, in a new environment and making enough money to buy a new car that he‚Äôd been eyeing for years. What more could Bob want?

Three years into his career at IBM, Bob had one promotion and became a senior software engineer. But things weren‚Äôt looking good for Bob. Despite the elevation in his title, he didn‚Äôt feel like he learned much over the years‚Ä¶ except perhaps that most energies at his company were directed towards political battles and power struggles rather than on product and engineering.

After three years, Bob was still working on the same team, on the same legacy code base (which he became the expert of). Since the company had been around for decades, and likely overstaffed, things moved slowly. Even small changes required going through 3 different review processes that could take weeks, and likely months. Want to build a new product / feature? That was near impossible. Engineers at Bob‚Äôs company were treated as people who were given an exact spec of what to build / do, and were expected to deliver on that spec. There wasn‚Äôt a cultural space for engineers to propose and work on new products / features.

Bob saw his life flash before his eyes. Before he knew it, he‚Äôd spend the prime of his life at a company where he wasn‚Äôt challenged, excited, or growing. Gripped by fear of this dreary future, Bob decided he was going to leave and join a more exciting, product driven company that was actually growing. To a place where he felt he could be more alive & actually serve customers rather than serving internal company political wars.

Unfortunately, Bob didn‚Äôt feel like he learned much during his days at this company and feared how he‚Äôd fare interviews at companies with more challenging and exciting work environments. With this fear Bob kept pushing off actually leaving his company. He‚Äôd tell his friends every year during New Year get-togethers that this would be the year he‚Äôd quit. But for one reason or the other, that day never came. Two more years passed and now Bob was 5 years into his first job.

As a way to cope with his lack of learning and growth, Bob became jaded with work. He injected this dread towards work to any young person he came across: ‚ÄúWork is fine and all, but it‚Äôs not everything, make sure you find something you‚Äôre actually passionate about outside of work‚Äù. But that‚Äôs easier said than done. He eventually bought a house with a mortgage and decided to settle down a bit.

Around the same time Bob‚Äôs company laid off 20% of its staff due to poor business and he was unfortunately one of those let go. Unprepared for this situation and without the competence to actually earn jobs anywhere, Bob had an uphill battle in front of him. He also didn‚Äôt have much time to figure it out since he had a mortgage he was liable for‚Ä¶ üòû

After 5 years, Bob was disillusioned with work, and the world. And Bob feared what would happen next.

Back to the spring of 2013. Alice had no internships under her belt. She had instead spent summers doing research for a professor at her college, and therefore Alice had no active job offers. By the time Alice graduated, she managed to land one job offer from a company close to campus, but she didn‚Äôt feel like they were a good fit for what she wanted to work on, so she decided to spend more time job hunting and preparing for interviews to join a better company.

Her peers ended up starting full-time roles at companies they‚Äôd interned at over the previous years while Alice kept grinding away.

Half a year had passed. Because Alice went to a college that most people hadn‚Äôt heard of, and because she had no prior experience, Alice wasn‚Äôt hearing back from the companies she actually wanted to work at. But she decided that she‚Äôd give this process 1 year, and if she didn‚Äôt get a job at a company she was actually excited to work at, then she‚Äôd pick from the options she had. She lived at home with her family in order to keep costs low so that she could afford to take this extra time with job hunting.

At the nudging of her friend and in order to hone her skills, Alice started building projects in the open so that she could get feedback from the larger community of software engineers and builders. She launched a new project every week to hone her skills with a popular web framework, and published it to her blog while creating a ‚Äúmaking of‚Äù video that had the highlights of her codebase. After 2 months of building 7 projects, Alice felt much more confident in presenting herself to the world.

She then made a list of 10 companies that made products that she actually used on a regular basis. She did the research on these companies to find the manager on teams that she wanted to work on, and cold emailed each of them with a short blurb on who she was, what she could bring to the table and a link to a project that she was most proud of.

Out of the 10 managers she cold emailed, 7 ignored her, 1 told her to not cold email him again and to just apply online, and 2 who were thrilled that Alice took the the time and effort to reach out and were excited to hop on a call with Alice to discuss opportunities on their teams.

Because Alice used the products these companies made, she was well prepared for the phone calls. Her genuine enthusiasm was contagious and led to onsite interviews where she performed well. Alice received offers from both of the companies.

She decided to join the smaller startup. The company was only 100 people strong, and had just raised 50 million dollars because they were growing so fast and unable to keep up with user demand. Alice knew she wanted to work someplace that was growing fast, and work on a product that she had an actual, emotional connection with - this startup felt like the right place to work, even though it paid $10k less than her other offer at a larger Tech company, but at a high 5 figure salary, Alice knew she could easily make ends meet and wanted to take the opportunity that was more aligned with her.

In her first few months, Alice struggled very hard to keep up with all that was happening, and didn‚Äôt quite receive the mentorship she felt that she needed. She was terrified that perhaps she wasn‚Äôt cut out for this work and had contemplated leaving everything and going someplace moving at a pace that she was more comfortable with, and with mentorship she deeply wanted.

But because her company was growing so fast, it had begun to attract the attention from some of the top engineers in the world, who were now applying to the company. By Alice‚Äôs 6 month mark, her team brought on board a senior engineer who was previously instrumental in the development of a very popular app that Alice and all of her friends use every single day. And even better, this senior engineer became Alice‚Äôs mentor.

Things changed rapidly. New features were pushed out every single week. Bugs had to be fixed no matter the time of day or which day it was. Alice was working harder than she‚Äôd ever worked, but she enjoyed it at the same time. For her mind, Alice felt this was the right environment: working at breakneck pace with equally excited and motivated peers, all while seeing the fruits of her labor reach users every week!

After 2 years at this startup, Alice was made the team lead for a new feature that Alice had proposed to the company based on her personal experience using their product. This was an exciting step for Alice. Though she loved to engineer, she also realized that she has a deep appreciation and excitement towards product design and engaging with users on a regular basis to validate ideas and figure out what was important to build next.

She spent the next 2 years as a product lead on the feature that she helped start and had.

By this point, Alice had kickstarted a product feature that was used heavily by over half of all users, hired and built a team around this feature, explored various hats: engineer, product manager, customer support and had first hand experience for what it took to bring a new product to the world and grow it.

Of course there was tremendous effort and pain to keep up with the pace, but Alice felt quite satisfied every time she looked back at her journey. She couldn‚Äôt have imagined being able to learn what she had in such a short period of time. She‚Äôd never had a learning experience as meaningful and practical as this one, and as a result Alice felt a confidence she‚Äôd never felt before.

She knew that whatever happened, her mind was now extremely desirable at countless other companies and she had the option to go wherever, or even start her own thing if she desired.

After 5 years, Alice was thriving.

Despite starting off in a worse position, after 5 years Alice is valued significantly more by the market than Bob. Why?

### How you're valued

The job market values you by how much you can impact a company's bottom line. A company is an entity that optimizes for long-term profits above all else. Therefore your **ability to create economic value** at a company is what dictates your value on the market.

Everything ties back to the value you can create.
1. More passionate teammates are better for team morale and productivity, resulting in greater profits.
2. A more diverse team enables the company to serve a more diverse customer base well, resulting in greater profits.

If a particular hiring ethos doesn't lead to greater long-term profits, then it's just lip service that'll be revoked eventually. Follow the money to make sense of decisions. Every company has strong financial pressures - by design. No matter how big or successful the company, sooner or later [x] the pressure to financially grow will return. 

A company is a **living organism**: money is food and its survival instinct is its most powerful, subconscious force that will always rear its head when times get tough.

### True vs. proxy signals of competence.

But it's incredibly difficult for a company to evaluate your true ability to create value. For example, if you're a fresh graduate with minimal work experience, how can someone know your actual ability to create value in a company setting?

Therefore a company uses "proxy" signals such as where you've worked previously, who you worked with, where you went to college, etc. to gauge your competence due to the lack of real signals.

Most companies work to minimize hiring risk. Rather than aim txo get the best, they work to ensure that each hire is "good enough" because the cost of hiring bad is far worse, in the short-term, than not hiring great.

(TODO: Tie this back ot the Bob and Alice. Bob had better proxy signals to start off with, and therefore found it much easier to get interviews than Alice - who had no internships under her belt).

Faking proxy signals isn't a powerful long-term strategy. At some point, the world will know whether you can create value or not. especially to score important roles in the best companies, you need to have a track record of actually creating value.

You don't rise to become the CTO / CEO of a large tech company through your career by simply having a "Forbes __ under __ " award, glowing recommendations from other people, or degrees from prestigiuos institutions. You rise to the most lucrative positions by having a track record of creating outsized value *(TODO: explain this more clearly).*

It might be tempting to "fake it till you make it". That could be fine early on, but be cautious: the longer you train your mind to optimize for proxy signals of competence, the more difficult it becomes to bring yourself out of that mindset.

**Brainstorming**:
* Most of us will work to move from proxy signals to true signals of competence. Proxy signals of competence can be very helpful to get your foot in the door because they enable someone to take a bet on you, but it usually isn't enough for someone to depend on you to achieve a certain result.
* What exactly is a true, irrefutable signal? 
	* Showing clearly, without doubt, that you created something of great value. (Show, not tell). **This is why the most powerful "resumes" are one liners. You don't need many words to justify / explain true signals of competence.** You just show it :).
	* Let's explain this with examples:
		* Gmail (Paul)
		* Susan Kare
		* Parag Agarwal.
* Proxy signals:
	* Proxy signals have a compensation ceiling in what companies are willing to pay you because no one knows the actual value you can create.
	* The value of a proxy signal changes over time. If you had the badge of, say, working at Google in 2010, you would have been valued a lot more than saying the same thing in 2020. Same thing by going to a particular institution, etc.
	* The chase for proxy signals of competence is actually one of the biggest challenges with job seekers today. The value of weak proxy signals is falling (e.g. having a 4 year degree in computer science from an average university) because it's easier to see if you can actually do shit or not (unlike the past in which measuring individual creative performance was far more difficult, leading to mediocre talent getting jobs on the basis of weak proxy credentials). So don't rely for long on such a flimsy tool. Use it as a rackshack boat to get into your first job, but then you must push to develop true competence.
* How to build true signal of competence?  
	* For those that don't have powerful proxy signals of competence: that's totally fine. Buildling true competence is a permissionless task: as long as you have an internet connection and a device to access it, you can build true competence: the skill to create value in this world.
* **Conclusion**. Therefore "thriving" in your career can be boiled down to developing true, irrefutable competence in creating value in this world. Let's explore exactly what skills we need to train to create value, and then use that understanding to choose the jobs that maximize our learning rate of these key skills.

Take the shortest path to developing an **unrefutable**, **true signal** of competence.

What are the right skills to learn to develop a true signal for competence?

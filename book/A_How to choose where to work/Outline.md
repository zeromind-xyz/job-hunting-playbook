Forget everything we have till now. How would you start the outline? (Don't even consider essay breaks or anything. Just an entire flow to address: "**Where you should work**")

* Clear definition of what it means to thrive, and that the entire goal of this playbook is to enable you to thrive. Consider having an entire chapter on this to really reinforce this concept.
* Tale of 2 stories: Alice & Bob.
* How a company values you: your ability to create a positive impact on its bottom line - proportional to how much value the company thinks you can create. *(this needs to be up front and center because this is the CRUX of the entire playbook).* 
	* This isn't as dry as it sounds. Everything ties back to this: more passionate teammates are better for team morale and productivity. A more diverse team enables the company to serve a more diverse customer base more easily. If a trait doesn't impact the bottom line, then it's just lip service, without an actual investment. A for-profit company isn't a non-profit. It has financial pressures that it will never be able to avoid - by design. Don't expect anything else.
* But evaluating true ability to impact bottom line is too time consuming, hence world looks at proxy signals of competence to gauge your value.
	* What are these proxy signals?
	* How are they ranked in terms of effectiveness?
* But **faking is a suboptimal** strategy. Learning how to actually create value is far more effective than optimizing for some proxy signal / credential. You want to create your own brand. *(There are also many more disadvantages to faking it that we'll cover in "Right mindset")*
* What are the right skills that positively impact the bottom line?
	* Work backwards from creating value to understanding the skills you need to create value.
	* Knowing a framework / coding well is only one piece of the larger game. In and of itself it means nothing. You must tie every skill back to creating value. 
	* Companies are (usually) built with teams. By making your team better you can have an outsized impact.
	* Effectiveness > Likeability. A likeable person who cannot create value will eventually be let go. If they're not, then the company suffers - making it a bad place to be to cultivate the skills you need to thrive.
	* (Elaborate the key skills you need in order to thrive in your career).
* Control your destiny.
	* Outcomes in creative domains have high variance, high range. Range is only increasing as the overall wealth created in the world is increasing (and especially in Tech.).
		* Some interesting facts: e-commerce still < 10% of all commerce. Look at just how rapidly software will eat the world in the coming decade.
	* Power law distribution: most value is captured by small percentage.
* Maximizing learning rate is the top priority.
	* Learning compounds exponentially, not linearly.
	* What is learning?
		* Tie this to neuroscience. Our minds are like large neural nets.
	* Experience is measured in iterations, not time.

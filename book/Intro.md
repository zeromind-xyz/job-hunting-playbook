I want to show you how to **thrive in your career.** I define **thriving** as being able to work on the problems you find most meaningful, from wherever you want, with people you respect, while creating wealth that makes working an active choice rather than a necessity.

We live in an incredible age in which anyone with a computer, internet connection, the right knowledge and sufficient determination can train themselves to thrive in their careers… regardless of where they live & regardless of what credentials they may or may not have.

Software is eating the world rapidly and every industry you can imagine, whether it’s constructing homes, manufacturing clothing, making movies, moving objects / people from one place to another - will be dominated by software.

Despite what it may feel like due to the current state of the economy, we’re still incredibly early in this movement. The demand for great technologists far, far outstrips supply.

The pandemic has created a fundamental shift in how the world works. Remote work is no longer restricted to the San Francisco tech elite, but now an integral part of the culture at all kinds of companies. Companies have realized that the cost savings from remote work (or partial remote work) has justified the potential drop on productivity. And while just a few years ago it was incredibly difficult for companies to hire remotely from different countries, it’s gotten significantly easier today as startups and governments have reduced the legal and administrative burdens in hiring from around the world in order to cope with the pandemic.

What does this mean for job hunters? Opportunities that were previously restricted to those near Tech hubs are now accessible from anywhere. A talented engineer from Dhaka, or a great designer from Norway, can now compete for opportunities at many of the top startups and tech companies around the world.

Job hunting is a skill that enables you to take advantage of this opportunity. This skill boils down to 3 components. You must be able to:

1.  Identify the right companies to work at where you can grow.
2.  Earn a place at those companies.
3.  Manage your psyche.

These skill are like 3 legs of a stool. Weakness in any one of them leads to a weak foundation to build your career on.

The sections in this playbook cover each component: 1. Choose where to work, 2. Get interviews, 3. Manage your mind.

In addition to theory, I’ve included real world examples where possible and have extensively referenced ideas from wiser, smarter folks - which I’ve linked to at the end of each section.

### Why?

**Firstly, most people underestimate the cost of working at a company that’s a bad fit for them**. Humans aren’t stagnant: we’re either growing in the ways that we want to through learning skills and habits from those around us, or we’re atrophying.

Sadly, I’ve consistently seen motivated, sharp, ambitious peers take up jobs that aren’t good matches for them, that led to them not enjoy their work, eventually underperforming and also becoming jaded & unhappy.

Joining the wrong company, especially early in your career, can be extremely harmful for your growth because you’ll learn bad habits and mindsets that will hold you back in your career, and life.

**Secondly, most people suck at the art of job hunting**. Most job “hunters” solve a bunch of Leetcode programming questions, pad up their resumes with trending buzz words, apply online to a bunch of companies, and simply wait to hear back... I call these people “job waiters” rather than job hunters. Don’t be one of them. **“Hunting”** ought to put an image in your mind of chasing opportunity: being pro-active and continuously finding ways to move closer to your goals.

I’ve also found that most universities are terrible at teaching upcoming graduates how to job hunt. Sure, top tier colleges can get A-list companies to come to their career fairs, but even those companies are a fraction of the number of fulfilling, exciting companies that you can work at. By relying only on the opportunities that come to you instead of understanding the extent of opportunities that exist and making an informed choice from that larger pool - you’re not taking full advantage of your situation.

Last but not least, the art of job hunting is a skill that isn’t restricted to the job hunt. At its core, the art of job hunting is about creating opportunities for yourself - a skill that will help you identify and create opportunities within an organization, or even when you launch your own product.

I wrote the first version of this playbook in 2019 as a way to train new grads on how to get interviews at Tech companies. It’s helped many new grads effectively get interviews at startups as well as larger Tech companies and kickstart their careers. After the pandemic completely shook up the world, I felt it was time for an updated version of this playbook that was adapted to our new world order, and expanded to discuss how to choose the right job in addition to just showing how to get interviews.

### Who is this for?

Software engineers job hunting in Tech. This playbook is especially useful for folks from non-traditional backgrounds (e.g. didn’t go to college or went to a college that isn’t well known in Tech hubs) because traditional job hunting strategies likely won’t work for you.

Who we work with and what we work on deeply impacts our lives. Our careers are integral to our wellbeing. From the bottom of my heart, I wish for you work on something you find meaningful and build a life that brings you peace, happiness and joy. I hope this playbook will help you accomplish this.

Godspeed.

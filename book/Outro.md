Break all the rules in this playbook if you see it fit. Fuck it, don't get a job, try drawing for a year / creating content. Heck, spend a few years meditating in the mountains. I didn't intend this playbook to be prescriptive in how you live life. The last thing I’d advocate for is to follow a path just because everyone you know is doing it. There are many ways to live life, more power to you.

But if you choose to enter the job market and use working in this world as a means to give back / contribute to the human civilization, then I wanted to share my learnings on how to effectively do that. That's all.

“Don’t take it all so seriously”. If there’s anything to take away from this playbook is that the path to effectively executing anything worthwhile is based on a experimentation. Systematic experimentation without losing focus, or giving up.

At the end of the day I believe your peace and happiness is paramount and everything I share is simply a tool to service that endeavor for peace. For most of us, we have to work - whether to support those that we love, or to fulfill some unrequited pressure from society to create something of value. Whatever the reason may be… (something something, need to finish my thinking here).

The way we bring peace to the world is by bringing it to each and every one of us. Our world is simply a sum of our minds.

I wish you the best.

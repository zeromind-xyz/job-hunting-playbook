## Notes on playbook
- Need to comprehensively define what a software engineer is.

OK, I'm officially cutting off access to my phone and therefore the internet along with it. Good riddance. Focus solely on writing the book draft. That is it brother. Don't focus on anything else. Only when the book draft is complete, re-enter the world. This is the best way to live. With focus, concentration and a sense of purpose.

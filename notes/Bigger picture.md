The more I think about the world and how humans operate in it, I see the need for meta level knowledge on how to create value that spans all forms of expressions: tech products, media, arts, etc. 

The fundamental skill that ties together artists across all domains: how to create value. How to be useful to others.

It feels profound. This feeling might pass for now, but my view of the world has fundamentally shifted. We need a much better system of collective brainwashing that enables us to thrive.

Humanity's current brainwashing methods are outdated: i.e. from the industrial age. It doesn't apply today because we literally have unlimited armies of robots at our disposal.

(*For now just brainstorming*)

Before focusing on growth, ensure that you have a solid product that is worthy of someone's attention. Growth doesn't do shit if the underlying product itself isn't that great. And a great product can amplify every ounce of growth effort.

After rounds of iterations and getting the playbook to what I consider 0.9, it's time to start executing on growth to enable the playbook to reach an audience beyond the people that I personally know.

What does it mean for the product to be great?
1. Extremely high quality actual content.
2. Extensive social proof - need to tap into network and get a great set of poeple (competent, recognized, diverse) to give me a glowing review of the playbook.
3. Beautiful, drool-inducing design and presentation.

That's it. That's all you need for now.

Channels:
- Individual essays that are published "as excerpts from the playbook". 
- Images + caption (communicating core concepts) - on Twitter.
- Short form videos across all plaforms, with an extra focus on Youtube and TikTok (for international audience).

1. Move real vs. proxy signals thinking high up in the thread: right after "Companies are designed for profits." And then build the grade-level system argument on the back of this point.

**High level outline**:
1. What is thriving?
2. How companies value you.
3. **Build true, irrefutable signals of competence**. (True vs. proxy signals of competence).
4. Evaluate job opportunity by how quickly it will enable you to 

I love this focus on building true signals of competence: i.e actually creating value. It's a simple yet powerful focus point for the entire playbook.

Every career decision will essentially boil down to this: will this experience help you create value or not? It's that simple. Powerful.

OK, there's a different, more effective approach to take here:
1. Fuck the "choosing where to work" angle and quickly just launch "How to get interviews". A ton of people have been laid off and many are on visas and need new jobs very quickly. Can focus on that audience to start with - the market is hot.
2. **On the other hand, stick to the gameplan: focus on creating an end-to-end value product and give it to the right audience. This feels better. But **why** does it feel better? Are you delaying the inevitable? What's going on?**

I'm sticking to the gameplan. Stop falling into short term market waves. The audience is college students. Give them the best possible playbook to thrive in their careers. That's the goal. Take as much fucking time as you need to get this playbook to that point. Quality matters. Product quality amplifies growth like nothing else. You must have a product that you are PROUD to sell to college kids - that you KNOW is going to benefit them.

Focus on quality. Once you have quality. Be stupidly ambitious on the growth and distribution.
Done.

And besides, I don't want to deal with the desparate "I just want whatever job today so that I can stop feeling social pressure" crowd. I want to deal with the more ambitious "I want to learn what I need to do win, and then do that really well" crowd.

Ofc sometimes the latter will feel strong financial pressures to get something today, but I only want those that are patient and persistent to work this system even after they get some mediocre first job and aim to thrive in the long-run. Amen.

I'm not convinced that we even need to talk about "Right skills in this tweetstorm... ". Hmm... interesting.

Notes from: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJZbv4J6FZ8Dnb0JuMhJxTnwl-dwqx5xl0s65DE3wO8/preview#: 

Something I hadn't considered: the reason that companies cannot have a variance in pay outcomes, even though the talent might warrant it is to prevent human problems within teams: i.e. jealousy and politics. If you allow for a huge variance in pay, and you end up fucking up one person's pay (i.e. paying them more than they deserve), then that's it. Morale falls, people will be lining up to lobby their ways to higher pays.

This is ridiculously poisonous for a company. Hence they implement what's called: Grade Level Planning: a detailed definition of every position in the company, and every seniority level, along with special compensation metrics for each position and level.

E.g: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeS9TDfedHUGnsY2JRNCJtNsZJRCDGUssmYgz3-JLD8/edit#gid=380521419.

My takeaways:
1. It's helpful to keep chapters MUCH shorter. Rather than a PG style essay, treat them as small, bite-sized pieces of information. It's more effective that way.
2. Presentation (reading mode) should be a flow: one comes after the other. That's the best way to organize all the chapter. Rather than have bite-sized individual chapters that you have to click to go to. Have doc in one super scrollable format.

BUT: don't assume this is the best format / way to communicate this knowledge. There could be better ways. Don't settle. Longer chapters work when it's more of a storytelling approach. Hmm... 

Hence I def think it's helpful to have a tweetstorm approach: it really condenses the information we're trying to communicate.

Next steps:
1. Write a tweetstorm for "How to choose where to work". 
	1. Describe the image that accompanies each tweet.
2. Expand each tweet into a "chapter".

This will FORCE you to be very terse in your explanations. This is a great exercise.

Each essay / chapter should be encapsulatable by 1-2 tweets. If you need more, you're not doing it right. So get fucking better.

High level outline for entire section:
1. **Unreputable, true signal for competence is ticket to thriving.**
2. Skills that enable you to develop the true signal for competence.
3. Maximize rate of learning of these skills (bec. learning compounds exponentially).
4. Evaluating job opportunities (based on above principles)
	1. Trade-offs. -> Yeah, stick this into this chapter. This one chapter should summarize the principles above and have a practical framework to evaluate job opportunities with. Important to make this a clear rubric, with the necessary space to be timeless: i.e. as applicable in 10 years as it is today.

### Proxy signals vs. true signals.
1. Any clear instances of having created value in the past?
2. Where you've worked before.
3. Who you've worked with.
4. Where you went to college.
5. And now other nonsense like grades, etc.

Aim to develop an **unreputable**, **true signal** of competence.

This is your ticket to thriving. And you don't need anyone's permission to be able to do this.

Unreputable: your individual impact is clear: did you lead the team? Did you build the first version? 

### How a company values you - OUTLINE
1. Bob and Alice storytime.
2. Alice is worth a lot more on the job market than Bob. Why?
3. Company values you based on the economic value you can create for the company. Every hiring decision culminates in this.
	1. At times hiring decisions deviate from this, which is suboptimal for the company. (But this does happen - how do you address this? Hmm... interesting question and something I haven't thought much about) -> Well, firstly that's a weaker positioning that depends on other people. Destiny is not entirely in your hands.
4. True competence very difficult to gauge, so companies look at proxy signals to evaluate your competence.
5. About proxy signals and ranked by effectiveness.
	1. Proxy signals have a ceiling. You must actually create value in order to break past that ceiling. It's that fucking simple.
6. **Conclusion**: So the goal in choosing where to work boils down to choosing the right places that train your mind in the skills that will enable you to create value - in the eyes of the world. Next, we'll undrestand what those skills are and use that understanding to evaluate how good a company is for our growth.

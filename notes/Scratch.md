I think a re-org is necessary:

1. How you're valued by the market.
2. Train the right skills.
3. Maximize learning rate.
4. How to evaluate job opportunities.
5. Understand trade-offs.

Why? 

Because I want to start with a contrasting story (bec. story grounds theoretical concepts), and I can't explain WHY Alice is valued a lot more than Bob without talking about how she learned more valuable skills, and how she learned them faster. Hmm...

Potential outline:
1. Bob and Alice
2. Alice is valued more on the market.
3. Market determines your value by your ability to create economic value at a company - proportional to the value you can create.
4. But it's very difficult to gauge the true competence of someone, hence we look at proxy signals to gauge competence.
	1. What are these signals? How are they ranked?
5. Why is Alice valued more on the market? It's because she actually CAN create greater value than Bob and has the right proxy signals that make her desireable.
6.

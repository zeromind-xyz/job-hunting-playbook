Feedback:
* I'm somewhat fine with "How to thrive", but there lacks a clean flow of narrative from this section to the subsequent ones. Need to thread it together.

Here's the high level outline:
* What is thriving
* True vs. proxy signals of competence.
* Founder Mindset that enables you to thrive
* Maximize learning rate of this founder mindset.
* How to evaluate opportunities to maximize learning rate.

### Visualizing Value

Which sections deserve visualizations?
- True vs. proxy signals of competence
- Resume becomes shorter as you get better.
- Chasing status vs. creating value.
- Learning compounds => rate of learning matters.

### Left out of Tweetstorm

*(What follows isn't natural continuation).*
* What is the right job opportunity that maximizes progress towards building true, irrefutable signal of competence?
* Great team.
* Opportunity to gain greater responsibilities with good execution.
* Must have a culture that __.
* If possible, choose in-person vs. remote. People underestimate in-person learning advantages when you're surrounded by great people.
* But remotely for a high learning rate company >> in-person stagnant company.
* Pre product-market fit startups aren't worth the risk. Most will fail. You're better off just starting something yourself. But ignore this advice if you see something special at an early stage startup. Prepare for suffering :).
* Rare for large companies to afford you the opportunity to fail __ (need to word this better).
* But you can be more creative than you think. Internet has opened up a new class of interesting, potentially high learning rate jobs. E.g. hustling your way as a tech person on Mr. Beast's team. Or building an AI software stack for an upcoming rapper.
	* Might look stupid today, but 
	- These learning experiences can actually be more fruitful than joining a company.
	- You could also consider starting your own thing.

**Company compensation** (This feels like more of a side point / additional benefit rather than be a part of the core thread. At the same time, compensation is important to spell out bec. this is the primary means of evaluating opportunities for most young folks).
* Companies have 2 compensation systems: "Grade-Level" and "Pay-Whatever-Necessary".
* Grade-Level is transparent step function: Engineer/Designer/Manager 1, 2, 3, principle, staff, etc. with clearly defined compensation packages. This transparency is good for the company: reduces lobbying for raises and internal politics.
* But Grade-Level pay systems often can't attract the best talent, therefore, companies pay whatever they can for top talent.
* Competence in creative domains (like Tech) has high variance and range. The best are orders of magnitude more effective than the average.
* Grade-level system severely undercompensates the best. The only way to earn what you're worth is to break out of the Grade-Level system.
* Having true signals of competence enables you to graduate out of the grade-level system.

**Founder Mindset**
* True signals are earned by creating value. Creating value is done by making something people want, selling it to them, and capturing some of the economic value created by your product.
* Creating value is the name of the game whether within a company someone other than you founded, or your own.
* Train yourself in the Founder Mindset.
* Earn the right to create value.
* By working on problems you actually care about, with teammates you deeply respect gives you energy to create value.
* -> Identify with the founder mindset, not some particular programming language / technology, etc.

**How to learn**
* Learning is measured not by time spent, but by iterations of the learning cycle.
* Learning cycle = talking to users, determining what to create, creating it, shipping it, measuring how well it does, determining what the next direction is. ()
* Rate of learning of the right skills that enable you to build irrefutable signal of competence is the most important factor when evaluating a job opportunity.
* Rate of learning is incredibly important. Learning compounds exponentially. In Tech there's no upper bound to what you can create once you break out of the mediocre, grade-level system. Break through as quickly as possible.

**How to get interviews**
(Finish the entire first section before you get here -> ensure that the foundation is laid well before you start building on it. This section is NOT independent of the first. It's an additional layer that puts into practice the theoretical foundation of the first section. Amen.).
* 

**Right mindset**


**Notes**
* Proxy signals hierarchy:
	* Competence by association, diluted by number of people that share signal: 
		* Part of a successful company during its rise.
		* Prestigious college.
	* Titles and status games (Awards, etc.).
* Thriving = escaping the grade-level system.
* Do this by doing whatever is necessary to create value. Don't be limited by your title. Creating value is often a cross-department, cross-role work. **If a company doesn't allow for this type of work, join another company.**
* Don't play status games. Do the best job you can at whatever you do to create value.
* At the end of the day, only true, irrefutable signals will enable you to thrive.
* Attitude is a super important factor in "right skills". It is a skill that must be trained. Talk about it there. Amen.
* A good heuristic: is there a way to earn the opportunity to fail? You cannot have true signals of competence if failure is not a possibility -> def need to reword this. I get the gist. But doesn't make any sense.
* Climbing grade-level system is literally a ladder / rat race. Creating value is far more freeing.
* It helps to be passionate about the problem the company is trying to solve - passion and purpose enable you to work harder.
* Work in-person if possble due to subconscious elements of learning from teammates.
* Working remotely with a better company is better than in-person with a worse one. 
	* Find an opportunity to move in-person ASAP.
* Thriving is a training of the mind, not any material outcome. Money can be taken, burnt, evaporated, burnt. Tough to steal your ability to create value... that can only be earned through the right mental training.
* Important point about finding the problem you're working on meaningful & respecting your teammates and the founders. This is a formula to bring out the best work rather than be a mercinary on compensation (bar exceptional cases in which you absolutely need immediate capital for some reason).
	* Stress this point. I don't want people to interpret this playbook as a mercenary path. Amen.
* The identity you identify with / attach yourself with is such an important piece of the puzzle. Possibly the most important piece of the puzzle.
* Dedicating yourself to creating outsized value for the company is what will protect you. The company you create value you for might not exist tomorrow, that's besides the point, but the tangible evidence of your ability to create value will not go unnoticed - and that will protect you.

**How to evaluate opportunities**
* Optimize for Founder Mindset learning rate.
* Cultural qualities of the ideal company to maximize learning rate:
* 1. Growing exponentially (in revenue, not employee headcount, awards or BS). (Verify via public records if company public, else via fundraising rounds).
* Growth is a pre-requisite for many positive qualities: __, __, __, ...
* 2. Quality teammates: low ego, high productivity, who work to make the team greater than the sum of its parts.
* 3. Moves fast: ships updates on a daily / weekly basis. (Verify via changelogs, tweets from team, and talking to current employees).
* Hurried does not mean moving fast. Only look at outcomes (rate of shipping changes) to understand a company's velocity. 
* 4. Consistently delivering is rewarded with greater ownership and responsibility. 
* Learning rate higher in path to success vs. path to failure. Try to join a winning team.

**Trade offs**
* Ignore legacy companies (whose prime years are behind them and growth has stagnated). Don't join a stagnating ship. You'll learn bad habits and will be worse off than when you started.
* Hardware vs. software:
* Hardware = hardware + software => (hardware + software) vs. software.
* If joining a hardware tech company, join one with a good oracle: someone who has a track record of shipping world class hardware products. Treat their feedback as market feedback to iterate on skills.
* E.g. Getting feedback from Steve Jobs on a weekly basis is closely equivalent to shipping a software iteration and measuring results.
* Without a strong oracle in hardware tech companies: learning rate is slow because the feedback loop with the market (key aspect of learning cycle) is missing, and failure rate is high (hardware is hard).
* Ideally join after manufacturing risk minimized (they've shown ability to actually ship quality hardware).
* In-person vs. remote:
* The best way to learn from a teammate is in person. Energy is contagious and physical proximity helps team energy transfer.
* If you're not in a global Tech hub & cannot immediately move to one (due to Visa / other issues), work remotely with a great team.
* Working with great company remotely > average company in-person.
* Startup vs. Big Tech:
* Two major phases in startup lifecycle: pre & post product-market-fit (pmf).
* Product-market-fit = the inflection point at which a company has made something people want and the demand for its product far outstrips the supply. Exponential growth in users / revenue often begins at this point. (read: https://www.ycombinator.com/library/5z-the-real-product-market-fit).
* Less than 1% of startups find product-market-fit. Unless you have strong reason not to, only join startups AFTER they've found product-market-fit (more deets on how in playbook).
* Lastly, ignore all advice if you have a strong gut instinct to work with a group of people you respect to build something great, even if they have no existing visible signs of growth or success. Follow that instinct. Learn from its outcomes.
* All the best.

----

**Maximize learning rate**
* It's not enough to simply learn the right skills to create value. Rate of learning is paramount.
* Learning is measured not by time spent doing something, but by your ability to create actual, tangible value.
* The second best (and more practical) way to measure learning is by number of iterations of the learning cycle.
* Learning cycle = determining what to create, creating, shipping to an audience, updating internal model of what to create.
* By choosing to work at companies that moves fast (more learning cycles), with teammates that are great at actually delivering value (measured by outcomes), you will learn exponentially faster than if you join an average company.
* In Tech, the range and variance of competence is high, without an upper bound. The best engineer / designer / product manager will have 100x more opportunities and will be compensated 100x higher than the average.
* Fortunately in Tech, you don't have to sacrifice much baseline compensation in order to optimize for learning rate. Companies worth working at will pay you enough to live comfortably.

----

**Founder mindset**
* Train the Founder Mindset to enable yourself to create value and thereby build true, irrefutable signals of competence.
* Founder Mindset:
* 1. Obsess over creating long-term value. (Determine what people want, create, sell).
* 2. Seek truth. (Perceive reality as it is, not as you want it to be - about what the world wants and about what you find meaningful).
* 3. Do what's necessary. (Be attached to outcomes, not to roles / titles / tools required to deliver those outcomes).
* 4. Embrace ownership and responsibility. (Take calculated risks. Take responsibility for your failures).
* 5. Be honest. (Cheating & lying are habits that will prevent you from working with the best and creating long-term value).
* Focus on this internal system. External results will follow.

Thoughts:
- I want to insert the founder cycle: determine what the world needs, create, sell.
- I'm struggling to see the clear difference b/w obsess over creating value and truth seeking.

----
Need to define this well since it's the crux of the entire playbook: Founder Mindset = what you need to learn in order to thrive.

1. **Obsess over creating value**. (Grow the pie, not fight over scraps).
2. **Seek truth** (about what the world needs, how to build and get it to the world at scale, and about who you are and what you find meaningful).
3. **Do what's necessary** (attached to outcomes, not the roles / titles / tools to deliver those outcomes. Don't limit yourself to rigidly defined roles. Understand how to navigate various roles and responsibilities through upfront communication to get everyone aligned on what you want to do and why you think it's good for the company. The expanded point here is that you're not restricted by a rigid narrative on how you ought to work).
4. **Embrace ownership and responsibility**. (treats every task with responsibility).
----

(What are some other points worth considering?)

You have to boil this down further. Terse. Pithy. There's no time in a tweetstorm to express everything you feel about a certain thing.

Founder Mindset cycle:
1. Determining what to create.
2. Creating.
3. Selling.

Every other skill learned is to aid this cycle. Whether leadership, hiring, design, etc. Whatever the skill might be, stems from this fundamental creation cycle.

----

OK, I def like the emphasis on Founder Mindset -> could make that the core theme of the playbook. Well, True, irrefutable signal is actually powerful and should likely stay as the primary definition of "How to thrive". Founder Mindset is what lets you **earn True, irrefutable signals** of competence. That's the right relationship.

1. How to thrive (Thriving = having **true, irrefutable signals** of competence)
2. Founder Mindset
3. Maximize learning rate.
4. How to evaluate job opportunities.
5. Concluding

----

Key relationship: **Founder Mindset is the internal system that will eventually lead to the outcomes you desire**. Mindset is in your hands. Its outcomes are not, but they will be deliverd in due time.

This is it. 3 act piece for the opening section. Will likely have to break it apart further, but this is a powerful foundation.

High level ordering feedback:
1. What does it mean to thrive?
	1. Define
	2. Signals of competence.
	3. Types of compensation.
	4. Wealth creation involves holding equity. But more importantly, if you **develop true signals** of competence, you can systematically achieve high equity and compensation.
2. Founder Mindset enables you to create value.
	1. Internal process
	2. Choosing the right environment (i.e. choosing where to work)
4. Trade-offs (remote / in-person, small / big, choosing a region, etc.).


--> It all comes down to building true signals of competence. That's where the game is at. 


----

Ways to break this down:
1. Get the high level ordering correct (there are currently 4 sub-threads here. Will you keep all of them?).
2. Ordering WITHIN first section: and figure this out.

----
1. Move real vs. proxy signals thinking high up in the thread: right after "Companies are designed for profits." And then build the grade-level system argument on the back of this point.

**High level outline**:
1. What is thriving?
2. How companies value you.
3. **Build true, irrefutable signals of competence**. (True vs. proxy signals of competence).
4. Evaluate job opportunity by how quickly it will enable you to 

I love this focus on building true signals of competence: i.e actually creating value. It's a simple yet powerful focus point for the entire playbook.

Every career decision will essentially boil down to this: will this experience help you create value or not? It's that simple. Powerful.

----

OK, there's a different, more effective approach to take here:
1. Fuck the "choosing where to work" angle and quickly just launch "How to get interviews". A ton of people have been laid off and many are on visas and need new jobs very quickly. Can focus on that audience to start with - the market is hot.
2. **On the other hand, stick to the gameplan: focus on creating an end-to-end value product and give it to the right audience. This feels better. But **why** does it feel better? Are you delaying the inevitable? What's going on?**

I'm sticking to the gameplan. Stop falling into short term market waves. The audience is college students. Give them the best possible playbook to thrive in their careers. That's the goal. Take as much fucking time as you need to get this playbook to that point. Quality matters. Product quality amplifies growth like nothing else. You must have a product that you are PROUD to sell to college kids - that you KNOW is going to benefit them.

Focus on quality. Once you have quality. Be stupidly ambitious on the growth and distribution.
Done.

And besides, I don't want to deal with the desparate "I just want whatever job today so that I can stop feeling social pressure" crowd. I want to deal with the more ambitious "I want to learn what I need to do win, and then do that really well" crowd.

Ofc sometimes the latter will feel strong financial pressures to get something today, but I only want those that are patient and persistent to work this system even after they get some mediocre first job and aim to thrive in the long-run. Amen.

I'm not convinced that we even need to talk about "Right skills in this tweetstorm... ". Hmm... interesting.

Notes from: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZJZbv4J6FZ8Dnb0JuMhJxTnwl-dwqx5xl0s65DE3wO8/preview#: 

Something I hadn't considered: the reason that companies cannot have a variance in pay outcomes, even though the talent might warrant it is to prevent human problems within teams: i.e. jealousy and politics. If you allow for a huge variance in pay, and you end up fucking up one person's pay (i.e. paying them more than they deserve), then that's it. Morale falls, people will be lining up to lobby their ways to higher pays.

This is ridiculously poisonous for a company. Hence they implement what's called: Grade Level Planning: a detailed definition of every position in the company, and every seniority level, along with special compensation metrics for each position and level.

E.g: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AeS9TDfedHUGnsY2JRNCJtNsZJRCDGUssmYgz3-JLD8/edit#gid=380521419.

My takeaways:
1. It's helpful to keep chapters MUCH shorter. Rather than a PG style essay, treat them as small, bite-sized pieces of information. It's more effective that way.
2. Presentation (reading mode) should be a flow: one comes after the other. That's the best way to organize all the chapter. Rather than have bite-sized individual chapters that you have to click to go to. Have doc in one super scrollable format.

BUT: don't assume this is the best format / way to communicate this knowledge. There could be better ways. Don't settle. Longer chapters work when it's more of a storytelling approach. Hmm... 

Hence I def think it's helpful to have a tweetstorm approach: it really condenses the information we're trying to communicate.

Next steps:
1. Write a tweetstorm for "How to choose where to work". 
	1. Describe the image that accompanies each tweet.
2. Expand each tweet into a "chapter".

This will FORCE you to be very terse in your explanations. This is a great exercise.

Each essay / chapter should be encapsulatable by 1-2 tweets. If you need more, you're not doing it right. So get fucking better.

---

High level outline for entire section:
1. **Unreputable, true signal for competence is ticket to thriving.**
2. Skills that enable you to develop the true signal for competence.
3. Maximize rate of learning of these skills (bec. learning compounds exponentially).
4. Evaluating job opportunities (based on above principles)
	1. Trade-offs. -> Yeah, stick this into this chapter. This one chapter should summarize the principles above and have a practical framework to evaluate job opportunities with. Important to make this a clear rubric, with the necessary space to be timeless: i.e. as applicable in 10 years as it is today.

### Proxy signals vs. true signals.
1. Any clear instances of having created value in the past?
2. Where you've worked before.
3. Who you've worked with.
4. Where you went to college.
5. And now other nonsense like grades, etc.

Aim to develop an **unreputable**, **true signal** of competence.

This is your ticket to thriving. And you don't need anyone's permission to be able to do this.

Unreputable: your individual impact is clear: did you lead the team? Did you build the first version? 

### How a company values you - OUTLINE
1. Bob and Alice storytime.
2. Alice is worth a lot more on the job market than Bob. Why?
3. Company values you based on the economic value you can create for the company. Every hiring decision culminates in this.
	1. At times hiring decisions deviate from this, which is suboptimal for the company. (But this does happen - how do you address this? Hmm... interesting question and something I haven't thought much about) -> Well, firstly that's a weaker positioning that depends on other people. Destiny is not entirely in your hands.
4. True competence very difficult to gauge, so companies look at proxy signals to evaluate your competence.
5. About proxy signals and ranked by effectiveness.
	1. Proxy signals have a ceiling. You must actually create value in order to break past that ceiling. It's that fucking simple.
6. **Conclusion**: So the goal in choosing where to work boils down to choosing the right places that train your mind in the skills that will enable you to create value - in the eyes of the world. Next, we'll undrestand what those skills are and use that understanding to evaluate how good a company is for our growth.

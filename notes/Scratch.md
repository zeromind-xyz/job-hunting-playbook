High level outline for entire section:
1. **Unreputable, true signal for competence is ticket to thriving.**
2. Skills that enable you to develop the true signal for competence.
3. Maximize rate of learning of these skills (bec. learning compounds exponentially).
4. Evaluating job opportunities (based on above principles)
	1. Trade-offs. -> Yeah, stick this into this chapter. This one chapter should summarize the principles above and have a practical framework to evaluate job opportunities with. Important to make this a clear rubric, with the necessary space to be timeless: i.e. as applicable in 10 years as it is today.

### Proxy signals vs. true signals.
1. Any clear instances of having created value in the past?
2. Where you've worked before.
3. Who you've worked with.
4. Where you went to college.
5. And now other nonsense like grades, etc.

Aim to develop an **unreputable**, **true signal** of competence.

This is your ticket to thriving. And you don't need anyone's permission to be able to do this.

Unreputable: your individual impact is clear: did you lead the team? Did you build the first version? 

### How a company values you - OUTLINE
1. Bob and Alice storytime.
2. Alice is worth a lot more on the job market than Bob. Why?
3. Company values you based on the economic value you can create for the company. Every hiring decision culminates in this.
	1. At times hiring decisions deviate from this, which is suboptimal for the company. (But this does happen - how do you address this? Hmm... interesting question and something I haven't thought much about) -> Well, firstly that's a weaker positioning that depends on other people. Destiny is not entirely in your hands.
4. True competence very difficult to gauge, so companies look at proxy signals to evaluate your competence.
5. About proxy signals and ranked by effectiveness.
	1. Proxy signals have a ceiling. You must actually create value in order to break past that ceiling. It's that fucking simple.
6. **Conclusion**: So the goal in choosing where to work boils down to choosing the right places that train your mind in the skills that will enable you to create value - in the eyes of the world. Next, we'll undrestand what those skills are and use that understanding to evaluate how good a company is for our growth.

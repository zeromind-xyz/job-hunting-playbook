* How to evaluate job opportunities in order to thrive.

**What does it mean to thrive?**
* Thriving = being able to work on the problems you want, with people you respect, while having wealth that makes working a choice rather than a necessity.
* Thriving is an achievable, learnable outcome.
* Time is your most valuable asset. Invest it wisely.
* Understand the game. Companies are designed to generate profits. A company values you proportional to your ability to impact its bottom line.
* Companies have 2 compensation systems: "Grade-Level" and "Pay-Whatever-Necessary".
* Grade-Level is transparent step function: Engineer/Designer/Manager 1, 2, 3, principle, staff, etc. with clearly defined compensation packages. This transparency is good for the company: reduces lobbying for raises and internal politics.
* But Grade-Level pay systems often can't attract the best talent, therefore, companies pay whatever they can for top talent.
* Competence in creative domains (like Tech) has high variance and range. The best are orders of magnitude more effective than the average.
* Grade-level system severely undercompensates the best. The only way to earn what you're worth is to break out of the Grade-Level system.
* How your competence is evaluated determines which pay system you fall into. You're evaluated by either **proxy** signals or **true, irrefutable** signals of competence.
* True, irrefutable signals of competence comes from tangibly creating value in a way that doesn't leave room for doubt over your abilities.
* Your resume becomes shorter as you develop true signals of competence. The most powerful resume is not having one: when your reputation for creating value precedes you.
* Thriving = not needing a resume.
* E.g. "Created Gmail." / "Designed first set of icons, typefaces for Macintosh." / "Led enterprise cloud business to $10m annual recurring revenue (3x) over 18 months."
* Proxy signals are signals gained by association with others who share that signal and have also created value. Working on a team / company that performed well, degrees from prestigious institutions, awards, etc. Room for doubt over your competence exists.
* Having only proxy signals means more work to get interviews, longer interviews, compensation limited by grade-level pay system => not thriving.
* Having true signals means: ??
* Most people chase proxy signals of competence rather than focusing on creating true value. It's a limiting strategy (why?).

**Right skills to learn**
* Here are the skills that will enable you to 
* Experiential intuition for: knowing what to build, who to build for, building, selling and leadership are the skills that enable you to create value.
	* Notice I didn't mention any specific programming language? No one cares about that stuff. Use the right tool for the job to create value. 
* Experiential intuition is a subconscious process. Theory is helpful, but you must act in order to actually train your mind.

**How to learn**
* Learning is measured not by time spent, but by iterations of the learning cycle.
* Learning cycle = talking to users, determining what to create, creating it, shipping it, measuring how well it does, determining what the next direction is. ()
* Rate of learning of the right skills that enable you to build irrefutable signal of competence is the most important factor when evaluating a job opportunity.
* Rate of learning is incredibly important. Learning compounds exponentially. In Tech there's no upper bound to what you can create once you break out of the mediocre, grade-level system. Break through as quickly as possible.

**Evaluating the job opportunity**
* When taking a job, you are investing your most valuable asset: time. 
* Do hard research and evaluation before deciding where to work.
* What is the right job opportunity that maximizes progress towards building true, irrefutable signal of competence?
* Great team.
* Opportunity to gain greater responsibilities with good execution.
* Must have a culture that __.
* If possible, choose in-person vs. remote. People underestimate in-person learning advantages when you're surrounded by great people.
* But remotely for a high learning rate company >> in-person stagnant company.
* Pre product-market fit startups aren't worth the risk. Most will fail. You're better off just starting something yourself. But ignore this advice if you see something special at an early stage startup. Prepare for suffering :).
* Rare for large companies to afford you the opportunity to fail __ (need to word this better).
* But you can be more creative than you think. Internet has opened up a new class of interesting, potentially high learning rate jobs. E.g. hustling your way as a tech person on Mr. Beast's team. Or building an AI software stack for an upcoming rapper.
	* Might look stupid today, but 
	- These learning experiences can actually be more fruitful than joining a company.
	- You could also consider starting your own thing.

### Notes
* Proxy signals hierarchy:
	* Competence by association, diluted by number of people that share signal: 
		* Part of a successful company during its rise.
		* Prestigious college.
	* Titles and status games (Awards, etc.).
* Thriving = escaping the grade-level system.
* Do this by doing whatever is necessary to create value. Don't be limited by your title. Creating value is often a cross-department, cross-role work. **If a company doesn't allow for this type of work, join another company.**
* Don't play status games. Do the best job you can at whatever you do to create value.
* At the end of the day, only true, irrefutable signals will enable you to thrive.
* Attitude is a super important factor in "right skills". It is a skill that must be trained. Talk about it there. Amen.
* A good heuristic: is there a way to earn the opportunity to fail? You cannot have true signals of competence if failure is not a possibility -> def need to reword this. I get the gist. But doesn't make any sense.
* Climbing grade-level system is literally a ladder / rat race. Creating value is far more freeing.
* It helps to be passionate about the problem the company is trying to solve - passion and purpose enable you to work harder.
* Work in-person if possble due to subconscious elements of learning from teammates.
* Working remotely with a better company is better than in-person with a worse one. 
	* Find an opportunity to move in-person ASAP.
* Thriving is a training of the mind, not any material outcome. Money can be taken, burnt, evaporated, burnt. Tough to steal your ability to create value... that can only be earned through the right mental training.
